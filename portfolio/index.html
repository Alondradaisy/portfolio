  <h1>Alondra Daisy's Portfolio</h1>

  <h2>ABOUT ME SECTION:</h2>  
  <p>I'm Alondra Daisy. I'm a tall Swedish / Mexican gal standing at 5'11 and will most likely tower over others, which has its advantages that I'm proud of! I'm a lover of learning, living and movement. Throughout the years, I have had opportunities through experiences I've lived that have shaped the mindset I have today. I learn best when I am in an environment that fosters growth and collaboration. However, I do prefer to read solo, in a quiet place. I love being around others, but I also really value my own space. Balancing these two parts of me is what keeps me busy in the midst of everyday life.</p>
  <h2>BACKGROUND</h2>
  <p>Education:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Santa Barbara City College</li>
      <li>Portland Community College</li>
      <li>Portland State University</li>
      <li>Epicodus</li>
    </ul>
  <p>Job Experience</p>

    </ul>
  <p>Why Programming?</p>
    <ol>
      <li>I chose to sign up and dedicate myself to this coding program to learn how to communicate with, write and understand the language that computers understand. In the near future, I would like to build and create my own magazine, both in print and online, but also create an interactive app for the magazine. My decision to take this course was specifically geared toward my strong interest in learning as a pair, as opposed to learning to code solo. There are great advantages to learning in a similar environment to the work environment in this industry, so this was a priority for me. Through learning how to program I hope to be able to build my online and print publication, plus create an app with the tools and resources I've gained from the program.</li>
    </ol>
